        Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and its
        incidence is increasing worldwide along with population aging. Previous
        clinical and histologic studies suggest that the neurodegenerative
        process, which affects the brain, may also affect the retina of AD
        patients. <br />
        <br />
        Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive technology that
        acquires cross-sectional images of retinal structures allowing neural
        fundus integrity assessment. Several previous studies demonstrated that
        both peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular thickness
        measurements assessed by OCT were able to detect neuronal loss in AD.
        Moreover, recent advances in OCT technology, have allowed substantial
        enhancement in ultrastructural evaluation of the macula, enabling the
        assessment not only of full-thickness retinal measurements but also of
        inner retinal layers, which seems to be a promising approach, mainly
        regarding the assessment of retinal ganglion cell layer impairment in AD
        patients. Furthermore, retinal neuronal loss seems to correlate with
        cognitive impairment in AD, reinforcing the promising role of OCT in the
        clinical evaluation of these patients.
        <br />
        Therefore, OCT is a non-invasive test, which we believe will serve as a
        non-invasive ocular biomarker in AD patients that could be routinely
        used to evaluate and follow these patients, allowing a more
        comprehensive approach in this disease.
